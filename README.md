# 🩺 Cancer Risk Visualization and Prediction (Power BI Dashboard)

## 📌 Introduction

Cancer, often referred to as the *"silent killer"*, is one of the leading causes of death globally. In its early stages, it often goes unnoticed, causing emotional and financial strain to individuals and families. Early detection significantly improves survival rates and treatment outcomes.

This project presents a **Power BI Dashboard** that visualizes cancer risk patterns using personal health and lifestyle data. By exploring these insights, users can better understand risk factors and take proactive steps to safeguard their health.

The dataset used contains 1,500 anonymized patient records sourced from Kaggle, and has been cleaned and preprocessed to focus purely on analysis and insight generation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize cancer risks based on personal health and lifestyle features  
- Identify significant patterns that may indicate early warning signs  
- Empower individuals to make informed health decisions to reduce cancer risk
